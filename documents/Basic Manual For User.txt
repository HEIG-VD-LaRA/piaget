This manual is an unofficial manual created to help the user who have never use RHY before. 
This manual should help you understand some basic functions, features, and its capability of this robots including its codes.

***Introduction***
As you might have guess already, this robot was programmed using C++ programming language.  Most of the Program are divided into tasks system
where the program will go through these various tasks starting from task 1 to task 21 **require update if needed**
which are as follow:
 ,
  Task02(); // Faire un pas  move a little bit 
  Task03(); // Lire clavier  read keyboard
  Task04(); // Mouvements PTP move point to point
  Task05(); // Stratégie
  Task06(); // Entrées / Sortie  IO
  Task07(); // Affichage         Display
  Task08(); // Mouvements spatiaux  special movement for computing position of the robot
  Task09(); // (* Gestion de la diode fonctionnement *) Led blinking
  Task10(); // Analyse d'images
  Task11(); // GestionServoCommandesUSB    usb motor controller no use
  Task12(); // ajustement de la charge
  Task13(); 	// Tester Entree   -----------no use---------
  Task14(); // Communication
  Task15(); // Mesures plan laser
  Task18(); // Interpréteur Piaget  Multi tasking management
  Task19(); // Voice dictation
  Task20(); // Dialogue Manager   
  Task21(); // Map Manager

with the exclusion of task11 and task12 which are not in use anymore.

Most of the coding will be located in Task5 which is the most basic level of coding.  Eventhough it's level1 coding, this task bear the most 
effect on the robot's action and "Stratégie."


***Task5***
Like the main program, Task5 are divided into seperate "region" to perform different task base on what the goal the robot
need to meet before it finish.  Here are some of the regions that we had used:

Case 4xx		: deals with Navigation to set waypoint.
Case 15x and 4xxx	: deals with Follow and Guide
Case 7xxx		: deals with Who's Who


***To begin***
After you run the program, you need to select the task for the robot to do.  It's located on the Console right below "Saved," "Reset," and "Quit."

After the task is selected, you can give the Robot it Vocal Command "Go" and it will proceed as given.
